## Email Template

### Version 1: Formal & Detailed

**Subject**: Artha - Indian Market Adaptation of Dime

**To**: rafasohhh@gmail.com

**Body**:

```
Hi Rafael,

I hope this email finds you well!

My name is [Your Full Name], and I'm reaching out to inform you that I've forked Dime to create "Artha," an adaptation specifically designed for the Indian market.

ABOUT ARTHA

Artha (Sanskrit: अर्थ, meaning "wealth, prosperity") builds upon your excellent work on Dime, adding features that cater to Indian users:

• Indian Number Format: Display amounts in Lakhs and Crores (₹10L, ₹1Cr) instead of the Western format, which is more natural for Indian users.

• Hindi Language Support: Full translation to Hindi (हिंदी), making the app accessible to millions more users.

• Financial Year Tracking: April to March tracking instead of calendar year, matching India's financial and tax year.

• Indian Categories: 40+ categories tailored for India (Auto/Cab, Kirana grocery stores, LPG gas, Temple donations, etc.).

• Festival Calendar: Built-in support for 22 major Indian festivals (Diwali, Holi, Eid, etc.) with budget planning.

• Additional Features: Bill splitting, EMI/loan tracking, and payment method tracking (UPI, Cash, Card, etc.).

GPL v3.0 COMPLIANCE

I want to ensure I'm respecting the GPL v3.0 license correctly:

✅ Full attribution to you and Dime in the app (Settings > Legal & Credits > About Artha)
✅ Direct link to the original Dime repository (https://github.com/rarfell/dimeApp)
✅ GPL v3.0 license maintained and displayed in the app
✅ Source code will be publicly available on GitHub before/with App Store launch
✅ Clear statement that Artha is a modified version of Dime
✅ All your copyright notices preserved in the code
✅ No additional restrictions added

Source Code Repository: [YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE - will update after publishing]

APP STORE LISTING

App Name: Artha - Indian Budget Tracker
App Store Link: [Will update after approval]
Expected Launch: [Your timeline]

The App Store description clearly states:
"Artha is built on Dime, an excellent open-source budget tracker created by Rafael Soh. We've adapted it specifically for the Indian market..."

WHY I'M CONTACTING YOU

1. **Transparency**: I wanted you to know about this fork and adaptation.
2. **Respect**: Dime is beautifully designed, and I want to ensure I'm honoring your work properly.
3. **Compliance**: To verify I'm following GPL v3.0 correctly.
4. **Feedback**: If you have any concerns or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

I truly appreciate the foundation you've built with Dime. The codebase is clean, well-structured, and a joy to work with. By adapting it for the Indian market, I hope to bring your excellent design to a new audience that has been underserved by existing budget apps.

If you're comfortable with it, I'd love to mention in the app that the adaptation was done with your awareness (something like "Created with the knowledge and support of the original Dime creator"). But this is entirely optional and only if you're supportive of the project!

Please let me know if you have any concerns, questions, or feedback. I'm happy to make any changes needed to ensure proper attribution and compliance.

Thank you for creating Dime and releasing it under GPL v3.0. Open source projects like yours make innovation and localization possible!

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]

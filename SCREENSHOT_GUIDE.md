## Alternative Screenshot Ideas

If you want to change it up:

One screenshot showing 6 features in a grid

### Alternative 3: Video-style Sequence
Multiple shots showing one action (add transaction → see analytics)

### Alternative 4: Testimonial Style

## Testing Your Screenshots

Before final submission:

1. **View on Actual Device**: Transfer to iPhone, view in Photos
2. **Tiny Preview**: Screenshots look tiny in search results - are key features visible?
3. **Ask Others**: Show to 2-3 people unfamiliar with app - what do they understand?
4. **A/B Test** (after launch): App Store Connect allows testing different screenshots

## Iteration Plan

**Week 1 Launch**: Use basic screenshots (just app screens)
**Week 2-3**: Add text overlays based on user feedback
**Month 2**: Redesign based on which features users love most
**Month 3**: A/B test different screenshot orders

## Final Tips

1. **iPhone screenshots are most important**: Most downloads come from iPhone search
2. **First 2-3 screenshots matter most**: Many users won't scroll
3. **Show uniqueness early**: Lakh/Crore in screenshot 2
4. **Keep updating**: Change screenshots with seasons/festivals
5. **Consider video preview**: If time allows, 15-30 second preview video

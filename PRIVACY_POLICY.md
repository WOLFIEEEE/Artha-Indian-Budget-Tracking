## Legal Basis for Processing (For Users in India)

Under Indian data protection laws, this section clarifies our data processing practices:

**We do not process any personal data.** All data remains on your device or in your personal iCloud account. Therefore, no legal basis for data processing is required, as we are not a data controller or processor.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or process your data, we cannot:
- Access your data
- Delete your data (you must do this from your device/iCloud)
- Correct your data
- Export your data (you can export locally from the app)

You maintain complete control and ownership of all your financial information.

## Third-Party Services

Artha does not integrate with any third-party services except:
- **Apple iCloud** (optional, controlled by you)
- **Apple App Store** (for app distribution, governed by Apple's policies)

## International Data Transfers

Since your data is stored locally or in your iCloud account:
- No international data transfers occur through our services
- If you use iCloud, Apple's data storage policies apply
- You can check Apple's data center locations in your iCloud settings

## Compliance

This privacy policy is designed to comply with:
- India's Information Technology Act, 2000
- India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023
